// The device/pool/readback seam.
//
// The op definitions (kernels, ports, params, goldens) and the executor are
// backend-agnostic. Only three things differ between running under Node (Dawn
// N-API, `.read()` readback, explicit layout-bound pipelines — ADR-0003) and in
// the browser (`navigator.gpu`, `mapAsync`, single-flight + validate-or-null
// fallback): device acquisition, buffer allocation, and readback. Those three are
// exactly what already diverged between `src/gpu/spatial/*` and the demo's
// `docs-site/src/lib/gpuField.ts`; this interface unifies them.
//
// Phase 0 kept the surface small: enough for the native `threshold` op to run a
// real compute pass and read it back. ADR-0017 grows it with the pool API this
// header anticipated — lease/return by liveness — which is what lets a value stay
// GPU-resident across a graph edge instead of round-tripping through the host.
