/**
 * Strong references to the Dawn **Instance** and adapter, held for the process lifetime.
 *
 * These are not tidiness — they are the fix for the crash that made GPU work outside
 * vitest look impossible. `create([])` returns Dawn's Instance, which owns the native
 * event loop and the mutexes every later device call takes. If it is left as a local it
 * becomes unreachable the moment `getDevice()` resolves, V8 collects it whenever it next
 * feels like it, and the N-API finaliser destroys the Instance *out from under the still
 * live device*. The next dispatch then locks a destroyed mutex:
 *
 *     libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error:
 *     mutex lock failed: Invalid argument
 *
 * — or simply segfaults, depending on where the collection lands. That is why the
 * failures looked random and environment-dependent: they were GC-timing dependent. It is
 * also why a *non-allocating* busy loop never reproduced it while `knnBruteForceCpu` or
 * writing zarr chunks did — allocation is what triggers the collection.
 *
 * The adapter is retained for the same reason: it sits between the Instance and the
 * device and is likewise dropped by the spec-shaped API once a device exists.

/**

 * "I'm done with the GPU for now" — releasing while any GPU object is still reachable
 * (a pooled buffer, a cached pipeline, a TypeGPU root) faults when those objects are
 * finalised against a destroyed Instance. Measured: releasing right after the k-NN and
 * then writing zarr crashed 3 runs of 3; moving the same call to the end of the process
 * gave exit 0, 3 of 3.
 *
 * The pairing with `instanceRef` is the whole story:
 *   • hold the Instance while any GPU work or GPU object may still exist — otherwise
 *     the finaliser can destroy it mid-flight and the next dispatch faults;
 *   • drop it once the process is finished — otherwise the retained handle keeps the
 *     event loop alive and the process computes its answer correctly and never exits.
 *
 * A browser page wants neither half: it holds one device for its lifetime and there is
 * no process to exit. Long-running servers should simply never call this.
 *
 * Best-effort: `destroy()` failures are swallowed, because by the time a caller asks for
 * this it already has its readbacks and a noisy teardown should not fail work that has
 * already succeeded.
