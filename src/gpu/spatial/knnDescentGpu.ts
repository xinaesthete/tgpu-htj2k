// NN-descent's local join on the GPU — the piece that decides whether this project can
// embed a whole tissue section rather than a subsample.
//
// The exact search is O(N²·D) and no device fixes that: `knnGpu` is fast, but at 200k
// cells it is still a minute and a half of quadratic work. NN-descent replaces it with a
// fixed number of O(N·c²·D) passes, where c is the candidate-list width (~21) rather than
// N. That is the asymptotic change; moving the pass to the GPU is what makes the constant
// small enough to matter.
//
// **Why this parallelises cleanly, which is not obvious for NN-descent.** The textbook
// local join updates BOTH endpoints of every pair it evaluates, which on a GPU means many
// threads writing the same point's neighbour list and needing locks or atomics. The host
// implementation here (`knnDescentCpu`) already does not do that: thread `i` walks its own
// candidates, then its candidates' candidates, and offers them **only to `i`'s own list**.
// Each thread therefore owns exactly one heap and touches no other. No atomics, no locks,
// no races — and the GPU result can be compared against the host's directly rather than
// only statistically, which is the opposite of the situation in `umapLayoutGpu`.
//
// The cost of that choice is that a discovered pair improves one side rather than two, so
// convergence takes marginally more passes than a both-ends variant would. That is a good
// trade at this width: passes are cheap and correctness arguments are not.
//
// **What stays on the host.** Initialisation (random-projection seeding) and the candidate
// build, both O(N·k) and neither a good fit for a device — the reverse-neighbour pass is a
// counting sort with reservoir sampling. They are also exactly the parts where being
// precisely right matters and being fast does not. The heap and candidate arrays are flat
// typed arrays for this reason: they upload verbatim.
